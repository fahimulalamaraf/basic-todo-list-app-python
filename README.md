# Basic To-Do List App with Python

## Introduction:

Hello! Welcome to my journey to becoming a self-taught Python developer. Through this project and multiple projects to come shortly, I will dive into the journey of Python development through various projects. I have basic knowledge in C, C++, C#, and some intermediate understanding of Java. I am new to the syntax of Python and have gained insights into various concepts such as collection, OOP, and modular functionalities of other languages. 

This is my first project, and I am building a basic to-do list app from scratch. I will share my journey along the way.

## Goals:

My basic goal through this journey is to build a to-do list app. I will build an Interactive program with Python. My first goal is to create a Command Line Interface app from scratch and create reusable modules for my future experiments and implementation if I move further from the CLI app.
My second goal is to experience using a graphical user interface. I have no prior knowledge or experience working with GUI apps and am excited to experiment.

## Command Line Interface

This is my first dive into Python development. I started with the user interface on my command line and made sure it was easy to use. I switched from switch cases to conditional functions for better results throughout the program. I stumbled a few times because Python is a loosely typed language without data types or a semicolon structure. 

### Technical Discussion:

I started with the importing time feature. I wanted to show the user the current time and date first so he could plan ahead. I used string formatting for ease of visualization.
Next, I gave the user the option of what action he wanted to perform, either adding a new to-do, editing one or completing one. Users can type the function they wish to use on that current session.
I implemented the starts with function from the built-in library so users can quickly type the action they want to perform and write the command on the very same line.

### Memory Usage:

Every time our user updates their to-do list and exits the app, the data needs to be stored, so we implemented the read/write file operation on our app. The basic file I/O operation made our app relevant for usage over time and useful for further experiments. I created a simple module for File I/O operation, which can be reused in our GUI app. 

## GUI:


### Discussion:

Python at the start, I found it easy but complicated in its own sense as the syntax of my prior experienced languages were quite similar. Python is extremely loosely typed language and has the ease of coding for any developer., Through this basic app project I have covered multiple essential topics for python which through time and practice will help me become a well-sound python developer. Thank you!
